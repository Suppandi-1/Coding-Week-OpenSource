Intro: I like exploring different aspects related to software, especially operating systems like Linux. Understanding how they function and discovering new fetures. To further enhance my knowledge, I spend time on platforms such as GitHub, Reddit, and Discord, searching for open-source projects to contribute to.
   
I'm also intrested to new slills. I'm actively learning web development, machinelearning, and littel bit dabbling in app development. This allows me to engage in meaningful projects and contribute to the coding landscape on platforms like GitHub. I find the process of building and understanding the foundation of the tech world through codes truly inspiring.
 
I use to play football, going to gym in evenings, Firstly, I look  to achieve and maintain physical fitness and overall well-being. Secondly, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skill set in the coding domain

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better!

Why I am intrested to  opensurce : Because
1. I am so much facinated about the opensource theme : like anyone can come do some good coustomization on free avilable open-code provided by community, and leave the customized code for othes to use for, customize for. 
2. When i get better in tech skills i can make change to software , making them better adding my own creativity as that suits leaving for rest of community to check out and if they like it they will further contribute it

why I am intrested to opensource contribution : because
1. I want to learn and see things how people works collaboratively , how these big projects are by unknown contributers.
2. I want to explore how these projects are handled and created so that i get an idea and feeling of how big thech companies(non-opensource) works on a projects, I mean to say i am courious about how to feels to be a part of some big projects which are avilable for real world.
