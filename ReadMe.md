Intro: I like exploring different aspects related to software, especially operating systems like Linux. Understanding how they function and discovering new fetures. To further enhance my knowledge, I spend time on platforms such as GitHub, Reddit, and Discord, searching for open-source projects to contribute to.
   
I'm also intrested to new slills. I'm actively learning web development, machinelearning, and littel bit dabbling in app development. This allows me to engage in meaningful projects and contribute to the coding landscape on platforms like GitHub. I find the process of building and understanding the foundation of the tech world through codes truly inspiring.
 
I use to play football, going to gym in evenings, Firstly, I look  to achieve and maintain physical fitness and overall well-being. Secondly, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skill set in the coding domain

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better!
